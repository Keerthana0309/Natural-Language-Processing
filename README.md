1.)This project is to build a simple Movie Recommendation System using the MovieLens dataset (F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19.) . 

2.)The dataset will consist of just over 100,000 ratings applied to over 9,000 movies by approximately 600 users. 

3.)The data is distributed in four different CSV files which are named as ratings, movies, links and tags. For building this recommender only the ratings and the movies datasets are considered.

4.)The ratings dataset consists of 100,836 observations and each observation is a record of the ID for the user who rated the movie (userId), the ID of the Movie that is rated (movieId), the rating given by the user for that particular movie (rating) and the time at which the rating was recorded(timestamp).

5.)The movies dataset consists of the ID of the movies(movieId), the corresponding title (title) and genre of each movie(genres).
